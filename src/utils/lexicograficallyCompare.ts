// A ideia Ã© re-implementar o compartamento padrÃ£o do Array.sort

/**
 * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
 * If compareFn is not supplied, all non-undefined array elements are sorted by converting them to strings and comparing strings in UTF-16 code units order. For example, "banana" comes before "cherry". In a numeric sort, 9 comes before 80, but because numbers are converted to strings, "80" comes before "9" in the Unicode order. All undefined elements are sorted to the end of the array.
 * The sort() method preserves empty slots. If the source array is sparse, the empty slots are moved to the end of the array, and always come after all the undefined.
